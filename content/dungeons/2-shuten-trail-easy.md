</div>

The first real dungeon of Shiren's adventure after clearing Small Valley.

Shiren's primary goal at this point in the game is to build a castle.<br/>
In order to do so, he has to gather castle materials in the mountains,<br/>
make castle parts out of them at the summit, and then return to Napus Village. 

Clearing this trail unlocks Shuten Trail Mid

This dungeon has a lower difficulty, just as the name implies.<br/>
Monsters don't hit very hard, and there aren't any boss fights,<br/>
so you can likely clear it in one attempt if you have some experience.

Bracelets, staves, and arrows can't be found in Shuten Trail Easy,<br/>
so you'll progress through the dungeon while making use of scrolls and grasses.

Items on the ground are already identified, including weapons and shields.<br/>
You can check upgrade values as you pick items up, and none of them will be cursed.<br/>
Take your time to search for equipment, because even if what you find has lower stats,<br/>
you might be able to make use of it later on once you're able to synthesize.

# Floor Guide

### Green Forest (1-2F)

The only monsters that appear are Mamel and Chintala, similar to Small Valley.<br/>
Both monsters are weak, so you shouldn't have any trouble defeating them.<br/>
However, there's a chance you'll collapse if you become surrounded,<br/>
so step into a hallway and fight them one at a time if you see multiple monsters.<br/>
Recommended to get Shiren up to level 3 before proceeding to 3F.

You won't have any of the items you picked up in Small Valley,<br/>
so you'll start with just one Large Riceball the first time you enter.<br/>
Be sure to check every room on each floor, picking up any items as you go.<br/>
If you find equipment, go ahead and equip it right away.

There's an item called Savings Pot exclusively found on 1F of this dungeon.<br/>
It lets you keep your Gitan if you collapse, but it takes up 3 inventory slots,<br/>
so it's only recommended for those who aren't confident in their abilities.

### Bamboo Forest (3-4F)

Monsters include Weather Doll, Ashigarudon, Slug, Yamikichi, and Piko Hammer.

Slugs have a special attack that lowers strength, so avoid letting them act first.<br/>
If there's a 1 tile gap between you and a monster, stay still and perform an attack<br/>
to have the monster approach you instead of you moving toward them.

The other monsters only use direct attacks, so you shouldn't have much trouble<br/>defeating them if you leveled up in Green Forest as recommended.<br/>
Recommended to get Shiren up to level 4\~5 before proceeding to 5F. 

### Deserted Shaft (5-6F)

Monsters include Piko Hammer, Droplet Ninja, and Armordillo.

Traps begin to appear from this area.

Droplet Ninja places a Droplet Trap (deals 5 damage) on the ground when defeated.<br/>
Lure them into rooms or on top of items (traps can't be placed if the
tile is occupied)<br/>to avoid having them place the trap somewhere you're likely to step on.

Piko Hammer is a handy monster that destroys any traps it can see,<br/>
and often removes Droplet Traps left by Droplet Ninja in this area.<br/>
However, it has high attack, so be careful when fighting them.<br/>
If your HP gets low, use items such as Herb or Otogiriso to heal.

Armordillo can perform a tackle to make Shiren trip and drop items.<br/>
Fight with your back against a wall to avoid dropping items when tripped.

Hunger Puppet makes an appearance on 6F.

Hunger Puppet can sing a song that lowers Shiren's fullness by 5%.<br/>
You can buy some Giant Riceballs in the next area, so it's not a big deal.

### Shuten Halfway

Rest area where you can strengthen equipment and buy items from a shop.

#### Blacksmith

Strengthens a weapon for 1500 Gitan. (Once per adventure)<br/>
Usually the increase in upgrade value is +1, but on rare occasions it will be +3.<br/>
Can also remove synthesis seals and repair cracked bracelets.

|Service|Price|Info|
|-|-|-|
|Hone Weapon|1500|Increases weapon upgrade value by +1 or +3.|
|Erase Seal|1000|Erases 1 synthesis seal of your choice.|
|Repair Bracelet|500|Repairs a cracked bracelet of your choice.|

#### Trader's Shop

Offers items for sale including Otogiriso, Giant Riceball, equipment, and scrolls.<br/>
Since it's your first time through, go ahead and buy some Storage Pots and Otogiriso.<br/>
The shop offers a strong Beetle Shield, but you likely can't afford it yet.<br/>
Damage reduction from defense value doesn't make as much of a difference in Shiren 2<br/>compared to other games in the series, so it's not an essential purchase either way.

|Item|Price|Info|
|-|-|-|
|Nagamaki|700|Stronger than a Club.|
|Katana|900|Pretty reliable weapon.|
|Tribal Shield|1500|Average defense.|
|Beetle Shield|7000|Higher defense.|
|Giant Riceball|300|Restores fullness to max,<br/>and increases max fullness by 7%.|
|Otogiriso|500|Restores 100 HP when eaten.<br/>Increases max HP by 4 if HP is full.|
|Antidote Grass|400|Restores strength to max.<br/>Buy it if you got licked by Slugs.|
|Identify Scroll|500|Identifies a selected item.<br/>Unnecessary for Shuten Trail Easy.|
|Purify Scroll|1000|Removes curses from equipped items.<br/>Unnecessary for Shuten Trail Easy.|
|Storage Pot[5]|1500|Insert and take out items freely.<br/>Stock up on these if possible.|

If you happen to collapse 10 times before clearing Shuten Trail Easy,<br/>
a Trader will visit Napus Village and offer the above items for sale.<br/>
The Napus Village Trader will disappear after you clear Shuten Trail Easy.

### Inexhaustible Falls (7F)

Monsters include Hunger Puppet, Zalokleft, and N'dubba.

Zaloklefts steal an item on the ground or from your inventory, and will then warp away.<br/>
You can get the item back by defeating it, so search the current floor until you
find it<br/>if it stole a valuable item like a castle material or Revival Grass.

N'dubba disguises itself as an item and does a surprise attack when you try to pick it up.<br/>
Be sure to have plenty of HP before picking up items on floors where N'dubba appears.<br/>
You can recover HP quickly by stepping in place. (Hold B + A buttons together)

### Stalactite Cave (8F)

Monsters include the ones from 7F, along with Samuraidon and Horse Ronin.

Samuraidon is the level 2 monster of the Ashigarudon family.<br/>
It has a Counter Shield equipped, so a portion of the damage you deal<br/>
to it with a direct attack will be reflected back at Shiren.

Horse Ronin shoots Silver Arrows that pierce through characters from a distance.<br/>
Be careful where you stand, since its silver arrows can
defeat other monsters,<br/>resulting in Horse Ronin leveling up into a Horse Samurai.<br/>
Not even Dragon Grass is enough to defeat Horse Samurai in a single hit (79 HP),<br/>
so if that happens, rush to the stairs while moving in a zig-zag pattern to avoid arrows. 

### Abyss Gorge (9-10F)

New arrivals for 9F include Nigiri Morph and Tiger Tosser.

Nigiri Morph can transform an inventory item into a Large Riceball.<br/>
It's particularly bad if a Storage Pot gets turned into a riceball since you
lose all contents,<br/>so don't hesitate to use items to attack from a distance or prevent it from acting.

Tiger Tosser has high attack, and throws Shiren either at other monsters or onto traps.

New arrivals for 10F include Shagga, Landmine Ninja, and Sheep Priest.

Shagga doesn't have a special ability, but has high attack power.<br/>
Don't hesitate to use scrolls or grasses against it.

Landmine Ninja drops a Landmine when defeated, which halves Shiren's current HP.<br/>
Be careful of the Tiger Tosser + Landmine dropped by Landmine Ninja combo.

Sheep Priest is a dangerous monster that can halve Shiren's strength for 30 turns.<br/>
Taking longer to defeat other monsters means an increase in the amount of damage<br/>
you take per encounter, along with a greater risk of getting hit by special attacks.

There are usually multiple castle materials on the ground in this area,<br/>
so search every room to collect as many as you can.<br/>
Materials found in Shuten Trail Easy are of the lowest grade, so you'll likely<br/>
want to switch to higher grade materials after building up the castle a bit<br/>
to stop the Oni from easily destroying sections of the castle during later events.
