## Overview

Statues are one of the new gimmicks introduced in Shiren 2, and are modeled after monsters.<br/>
They can be found in all dungeons starting from Onigashima except for Shrine's Hidden Hole.<br/>
They're said to be made by Shuten Summit residents, but also appear in Sealed Room.<br/>
A continuous mechanical sound can be heard when Shiren is within a 11 tile radius.

Statues provide various effects to nearby characters.<br/>
Some are positive and can be of help to Shiren, but others have a negative effect.<br/>
Select negative effect statues will switch to affecting only monsters when Shiren has Trapper status.

Generally, the range of a statue inside a room is either room-wide, or a 1 tile radius around the statue.<br/>
However, the tiles along the walls are exempt from room-wide effects.<br/>
If the floor is a single room with limited view, a room-wide statue only affects characters in a 11 tile radius.<br/>
If a Great Hall Scroll is read, a room-wide statue will affect the entire floor.<br/>
There are some exceptions - Ouch Statue always only affects characters within a 1 tile radius,<br/>
and Scout Statue always affects the entire floor, no matter where it's located.

Statues crumble after being hit a number of times, with the durability varying based on the statue.<br/>
It's best to destroy negative effect statues right away to reduce the risk of accidents.<br/>
The number of hits needed to destroy statues is as follows:<br/>
Explosion Statue (1~2) ≦ Decoy Statue (2~5) ≦ Base Statue Durability (3~5) ≦ Ouch Statue (8~12).<br/>
If fire is generated on a tile where a statue is located (Blaze Scroll or Fire Staff), the statue will vanish.<br/>
Remember that for statues that are difficult to approach, such as Ouch, Bomber, and Sleep statues.<br/>
Landmine and Big Landmine type explosions will make statues vanish in a single turn as well.

Statues can be moved using a Knockback Staff or Pull Staff, but Swap Staff has no effect.<br/>
Dosukoi family monsters can sometimes be seen pushing statues around.

Enemies generally avoid attacking statues, but will attack them if the statue is blocking their path.<br/>
Piko Hammer family monsters will attempt to break statues in addition to visible traps.<br/>
Allies can target statues if they were attacked by them, such as Ouch Statue or Stone Toss Statue.

Statues are generally treated as items when being generated, so they're commonly found on islands.<br/>
They can also be generated blocking room entrances, but monsters usually destroy those right away.<br/>
Statues will never be generated inside a Monster House.

Lastly, an invisible and invincible statue can be generated under special conditions. (glitches section)

## Details

### Ouch Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/ouch.png" alt="Ouch Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>This statue attacks anything that<br/>moves next to it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Attacks all characters adjacent to the statue each turn, dealing a fixed 18 damage.<br/>
It ignores Sanctuary Scrolls, but it won't attack through corners and will occasionally miss.<br/>
Bracelets take damage, and it will send you flying if a Knockback Statue is present.<br/>
Equipment effects take effect from its attacks. (Counter Shield, Parry Bracelet, 弟 seal, etc.)<br/>
The statue won't attack Shiren if he has Trapper status.

Has the highest durability among statues, requiring 8\~12 hits to crumble.<br/>
Your adventure might come to an end if you happen to step on a Sleep Trap in range of it,<br/>
so it's best to reposition it using a Knockback Staff if it's in the way.<br/>
Dosukoi family monsters will still try to push it while being sliced up.

The statue won't attack Shiren inside the Halfway Well dungeon,<br/>
so you can circle around the statue to have it defeat monsters that are chasing you.<br/>
However, keep in mind that you won't gain much experience points if you do so.

### Pierce Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/pierce.png" alt="Pierce Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Any object thrown by you or<br/>enemies will pierce through other<br/>objects, creatures, and walls.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Thrown items pierce through objects and walls, similar to having a Pierce Bracelet equipped.<br/>
Items also pierce through Reflect Shield and Tonosamadon's ability to reflect items.<br/>
Applies to enemies as well, but no effect on items that are thrown in an arc,<br/>
such as Kappa family monsters using their special attack to throw items.

This statue likely has the highest potential for causing accidents.<br/>
From losing items by throwing them at Mixers to losing equipment from Kengo disarming you,<br/>
there's a lot to watch out for when a Pierce Statue is present.<br/>
Shiren 2 doesn't have a command to take a look around the room,<br/>
so be cautious of unknown statues in the room that are outside of your view.<br/>
It may be best to choose actions based on the assumption that the statue is a Pierce Statue.

### Onigiri Statue
