## Overview

Statues are one of the new gimmicks introduced in Shiren 2, and are modeled after monsters.<br/>
They can be found in all dungeons starting from Onigashima except for Shrine's Hidden Hole.<br/>
They're said to be made by Shuten Summit residents, but also appear in Sealed Room.<br/>
A continuous mechanical sound can be heard when Shiren is within a 11 tile radius.

Statues provide various effects to nearby characters.<br/>
Some are positive and can be of help to Shiren, but others have a negative effect.<br/>
Select negative effect statues will switch to affecting only monsters when Shiren has Trapper status.

Generally, the range of a statue inside a room is either room-wide, or a 1 tile radius around the statue.<br/>
However, the tiles along the walls are exempt from room-wide effects.<br/>
If the floor is a single room with limited view, a room-wide statue only affects characters in a 11 tile radius.<br/>
If a Great Hall Scroll is read, a room-wide statue will affect the entire floor.<br/>
There are some exceptions - Ouch Statue always only affects characters within a 1 tile radius,<br/>
and Scout Statue always affects the entire floor, no matter where it's located.

Statues crumble after being hit a number of times, with the durability varying based on the statue.<br/>
It's best to destroy negative effect statues right away to reduce the risk of accidents.<br/>
The number of hits needed to destroy statues is as follows:<br/>
Explosion Statue (1~2) ≦ Decoy Statue (2~5) ≦ Base Statue Durability (3~5) ≦ Ouch Statue (8~12).<br/>
If fire is generated on a tile where a statue is located (Blaze Scroll or Fire Staff), the statue will vanish.<br/>
Remember that for statues that are difficult to approach, such as Ouch, Bomber, and Sleep statues.<br/>
Landmine and Big Landmine type explosions will make statues vanish in a single turn as well.

Statues can be moved using a Knockback Staff or Pull Staff, but Swap Staff has no effect.<br/>
Dosukoi family monsters can sometimes be seen pushing statues around.

Enemies generally avoid attacking statues, but will attack them if the statue is blocking their path.<br/>
Piko Hammer family monsters will attempt to break statues in addition to visible traps.<br/>
Allies can target statues if they were attacked by them, such as Ouch Statue or Stone Toss Statue.

Statues are generally treated as items when being generated, so they're commonly found on islands.<br/>
They can also be generated blocking room entrances, but monsters usually destroy those right away.<br/>
Statues will never be generated inside a Monster House.

Lastly, an invisible and invincible statue can be generated under special conditions. (glitches section)

## Details

### Ouch Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/ouch.png" alt="Ouch Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>This statue attacks anything that<br/>moves next to it.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Attacks all characters adjacent to the statue each turn, dealing a fixed 18 damage.<br/>
It ignores Sanctuary Scrolls, but it won't attack through corners and will occasionally miss.<br/>
Bracelets take damage, and it will send you flying if a Knockback Statue is present.<br/>
Equipment effects take effect from its attacks. (Counter Shield, Parry Bracelet, 弟 seal, etc.)<br/>
The statue won't attack Shiren if he has Trapper status.

Has the highest durability among statues, requiring 8\~12 hits to crumble.<br/>
Your adventure might come to an end if you happen to step on a Sleep Trap in range of it,<br/>
so it's best to reposition it using a Knockback Staff if it's in the way.<br/>
Dosukoi family monsters will still try to push it while being sliced up.

The statue won't attack Shiren inside the Halfway Well dungeon,<br/>
so you can circle around the statue to have it defeat monsters that are chasing you.<br/>
However, keep in mind that you won't gain much experience points if you do so.

### Pierce Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/pierce.png" alt="Pierce Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Any object thrown by you or<br/>enemies will pierce through other<br/>objects, creatures, and walls.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Thrown items pierce through objects and walls, similar to having a Pierce Bracelet equipped.<br/>
Items also pierce through Reflect Shield and Tonosamadon's ability to reflect items.<br/>
Applies to enemies as well, but no effect on items that are thrown in an arc,<br/>
such as Kappa family monsters using their special attack to throw items.

This statue likely has the highest potential for causing accidents.<br/>
From losing items by throwing them at Mixers to losing equipment from Kengo disarming you,<br/>
there's a lot to watch out for when a Pierce Statue is present.<br/>
Shiren 2 doesn't have a command to take a look around the room,<br/>
so be cautious of unknown statues in the room that are outside of your view.<br/>
It may be best to choose actions based on the assumption that the statue is a Pierce Statue.

### Onigiri Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/onigiri.png" alt="Onigiri Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Monsters in the room will turn into<br/>onigiri when defeated.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Defeated enemies always turn into an Onigiri.<br/>
The Onigiri drop is separate from regular item drops, so monsters can still drop a second item.

Excellent statue that can be used to increase max fullness.<br/>
Unforunately, it doesn't appear in Road to the End. (Only Onigashima and Halfway Well).

### Gitan Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/gitan.png" alt="Gitan Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Monsters in the room will turn into<br/>Gitan when defeated.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Defeated enemies always turn into a bag of Gitan.<br/>
Onigiri Statue takes priority if both Gitan and Onigiri statues are present.

The amount of Gitan per drop isn't very large, but it can be a nice way to make money early on.<br/>
Can be used to stock up on Gitan inside Storage Pots to be used as projectiles.

### Trip Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/trip.png" alt="Trip Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Both you and monsters in the room<br/>will trip often.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Occasionally makes all characters in the room trip. Shiren won't trip if he has Trapper status.<br/>
Potentially causes costly accidents by breaking pots or dropping items into water.<br/>
Traders and Water Striders can pick up the items you drop.<br/>

Monsters also drop items when tripped, so this statue can be used to collect items.<br/>
Traders drop merchandise instead of Vouchers when tripped, allowing you to steal items.<br/>
Recommended to collect items until the wind blows if you find this statue in Road to the End.

### 10 Damage Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/10_damage.png" alt="10 Damage Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>All damage dealt and received in<br/>the room will be 10 points.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

All damage received by Shiren and monsters is converted to 10 points.<br/>
This includes damage sources like Quarter Staff, Counter Shield, and Landmine explosions.<br/>
Poison Grass remains at 5 points, and Landmine explosions will still one-shot monsters.

Useful when Shiren has low attack early game, or when inside Halfway Well.<br/>
Can be used to one-shot a Cave Mamel at the beginning of Road to the End.<br/>
However, this statue becomes a liability the deeper you progress since it increases <br/>the number of hits needed to defeat monsters with troublesome special attacks.<br/>
Rancor and Intolerable slugs are particularly dangerous due to their dividing.<br/>
It's best to destroy it right away when you don't need its effect.

### Identify Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/identify.png" alt="Identify Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Items picked up inside a room with<br/>this statue will be identified.<br/>Identifying reveals an item's name,<br/>strength, number of uses, and<br/>whether or not it's cursed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Items are identified when you pick them up, similar to Special Onigiri's identification effect.<br/>
Only the pot will be identified if a pot with unidentified items inside is picked up.<br/>
An unidentified Wet Scroll will remain as Wet Scroll when picked up.

One of the best statue effects with zero downsides.<br/>
If you're carrying some unidentified items, simply place them on the ground<br/>and then pick them up again to identify them.<br/>
Particularly great if you come across one early on inside Road to the End.

### Bomber Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/bomber.png" alt="Bomber Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Monsters in the room will explode<br/>when defeated.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Statue that looks like a Droplet Ninja, though the effect is closer to Bomber Ninja.<br/>
Monsters defeated in a room with this statue explode with the power of a Big Landmine.<br/>
Any monsters next to the defeated monster will also explode in a chain-reaction.<br/>
Monsters can still drop items, but the item will vanish if it's hit by a subsequent explosion.<br/>
Unlike Explosion Statue, this statue won't explode when it's destroyed.

This statue makes it extremely difficult to fight monsters inside the room it's located in,<br/>
since Shiren will take heavy damage as a result of defeating monsters at close range,<br/>
especially if a chain-reaction occurs when there are multiple monsters next to Shiren.<br/>
Ally monsters will also explode, so caution is needed when carrying Monster Pots.<br/>
It may be best to assume an unknown statue in the room is this statue,<br/>
since it rivals No Magic and Pierce statues in terms of dangerousness.

### Gravity Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/gravity.png" alt="Gravity Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Floating monsters can be trapped<br/>while inside a room with this statue.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Floating monsters can be trapped when this statue is present. Exclusive to Halfway Well.<br/>
The effect is nice, but it's often not around when you need it, so don't count on it.<br/>
It only affects monsters inside the same room, so it's a bit lackluster overall.<br/>
That said, a Great Hall Scroll can be read to make it apply to the entire floor.

Knowledge Staff can't be found in Halfway Well, so the in-game description<br/>can't be seen during regular play.

### Explosion Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/explosion.png" alt="Explosion Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>This statue will explode when<br/>destroyed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Explodes with the power of a Big Landmine when destroyed.<br/>
Has the lowest durability among all statues, breaking and exploding in only 1\~2 hits.<br/>
Can be used to one-shot strong monsters, but can be unreliable due to its durability value.<br/>
Piko Hammer family monsters can sometimes be seen self-destructing to it.

### Hoarder Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/hoarder.png" alt="Hoarder Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Prevents placing or throwing items<br/>while inside the room.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Prevents items from being placed or thrown.<br/>
Shiren and monsters won't drop items if they trip when this statue is present.<br/>
Monsters that throw or shoot items will effectively be sealed, including Kengo family<br/>monsters' equipment disarming special attack.<br/>
Monsters can still drop items when defeated.

Beneficial in the sense of sealing Kengo monsters or monsters with ranged attacks,<br/>but there generally aren't many opportunities to make use of it.<br/>
Unlike No Magic or Pierce statues, it doesn't really cause costly accidents for Shiren.

### Scout Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/scout.png" alt="Scout Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Reveals the location of items,<br/>monsters, and statues on the map.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Displays the location of monsters and items on the map, similar to Scout Bracelet.<br/>
This takes effect anywhere on the current floor, no matter where the statue is located.

Great statue effect to have around since it lets you detect shops and Monster Houses.<br/>
Use a Knockback or Pull staff to relocated it to a safe spot where monsters won't destroy it.

### Stone Toss Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/stone_toss.png" alt="Stone Toss Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Occasionally throws stones.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Throws a stone with 30 attack power at a random character in the room.<br/>
It isn't guaranteed to throw one every turn, but occasionally throws multiple turns in a row.<br/>
30 attack power means it deals significant damage when your defense is low early on,<br/>
but thankfully it doesn't seem to generate on lower floors. (30F\+ in Road to the End).<br/>
It's not fixed damage, so you can reduce the damage you take by increasing your defense.<br/>
It won't throw stones if a Hoarder Statue is present, and won't throw stones
at Shiren<br/>if he has Trapper status.

Can be particularly troublesome if one gets generated on an island.<br/>
It throws stones at monsters too, but the stones won't deal much damage against late game<br/>
monsters with only 30 attack, and you can't count on it to attack monsters consistently.<br/>
This statue can be destroyed in 3\~5 hits unlike Ouch Statue, so it's best to just destroy it.<br/>
Equip a Reflect Shield to make this statue a complete non-issue.

### Sleep Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/sleep.png" alt="Sleep Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Occasionally spreads sleeping gas,<br/>putting all creatures in the room to<br/>sleep.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Spreads sleeping gas in intervals, putting all characters in the room to sleep for 5 turns.<br/>
It only spreads gas after 6 or more turns have elapsed since the previous activation.<br/>
Characters in walls won't fall asleep, and Shiren is exempt if he has Trapper status.

You'll be able to move a minimum of 1 turn after waking up before it spreads gas again,<br/>
but it can be incredibly annoying since it slows down the pace of the game.<br/>
A monster entering the room while you're asleep can be quite dangerous,<br/>so it's best to destroy the statue right away, ideally using a Fire Staff to one-shot it.

### Knockback Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/knockback.png" alt="Knockback Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Both you and monsters in the room<br/>will be knocked back when hit.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Characters hit by direct attacks receive 5 tiles of knockback when this statue is present.<br/>
Characters that bump into another character due to the knockback will take 5 damage.<br/>
If a character is defeated as a result of knockback damage, the one who dealt the knockback<br/>will be treated as the one who defeated that character.<br/>
Characters with fast movement or multiple attacks will stop after dealing knockback.<br/>
Counter Shield and Samuraidon's damage reflection doesn't take effect when knocked away.

Generally positive, since it lets you defeat monsters without receiving counter attacks.<br/>
It can be used to escape sticky situations by having a monster intentionally knock you away.<br/>
The knockback takes effect when you take damage, so it can be used to reduce damage<br/>
from multi-attack monsters like Lashagga by effectively canceling subsequent hits.

### No Magic Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/no_magic.png" alt="No Magic Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Scroll and staff effects in the room<br/>will be nullified. Applies to both you<br/>and monsters.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Nullifies staves and scrolls, including thrown staves and magic bullets from outside the room.<br/>
Sanctuary and Explosion scrolls placed on the ground will be nullified as well.<br/>
However, Balance Staff still prevents tripping, and Squid Sushi Scroll still replenishes fullness.

It effectively seals King Tusker family monsters, but the negatives outweigh the positives.<br/>
In particular, it greatly limits your options if you're surrounded by multiple enemies,<br/>
so it's best to keep an escape item like Warp Grass on hand in case you run into this statue.

It nullifies Knowledge Staff, so the in-game description can't be seen during regular play.

### Decoy Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/decoy.png" alt="Decoy Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Monsters in the room will attack<br/>this statue instead of you.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Monsters ignore Shiren and prioritize attacking this statue when present.<br/>
Archdragons and Porky monsters use special attacks at this statue if Shiren isn't in view.<br/>
Unlike defeating a Snacky, the monster that destroys this statue won't level up.

It has lower durability than most statues, so it's not as useful as it may first appear.<br/>
Often destroyed by monsters before you get the chance to come across it.

### Sturdy Trap Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/sturdy_trap.png" alt="Sturdy Trap Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Most traps in the room will no<br/>longer break from usage when this<br/>statue is present.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Modeled after a Traproid monster, which doesn't appear in Shiren 2.<br/>
Exclusively found in Halfway Well, and prevents all traps in the room from breaking.<br/>
Mallets and Piko Hammer monsters can't destroy traps if this statue is present.<br/>
Monsters can be trapped without concern of traps breaking, so it's great for leveling up.

This statue always faces downward, even when moved by items such as a Knockback Staff.<br/>
This is likely because Traproid monsters don't appear, and other angles aren't in the game.

Knowledge Staff can't be found in Halfway Well, so the in-game description<br/>can't be seen during regular play.

### Item Effect Statue

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>In-game Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="itemPageImage">
      <img src="../images/statue/unused_1.png" alt="Item Effect Statue Image"/>
    </td>
    <td>Throw an item at this statue and<br/>monsters in the room will receive<br/>the effect of getting hit by it.<br/>For example, throw Flame Grass<br/>and all monsters will take damage<br/>as if they were hit by Flame Grass.</td>
  </tr>
