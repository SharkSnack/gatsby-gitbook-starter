## Overview

As the story progresses, Shiren soon finds himself having to build a castle for the village.<br/>
Castle Materials can be found within Shuten Mountain, and each category comes in 3 grades.

The basic flow is:<br/>
Obtain materials in dungeons → Make castle parts at the summit → Return to the village and build.

Your save file will receive a castle icon when you complete the castle.

## How to Build

There's a Processing Shop on the 2nd floor of Shuten Summit, right before the Raft Shop.<br/>
Talk to the person behind the counter to turn castle materials into castle parts.<br/>
Then simply ride the raft back to Napus Village, and Shiren will automatically build the parts.<br/>
Building takes an entire day, and you can't enter dungeons until you finish building<br/>the parts you brought back.

Oni will occasionally attack the castle later on, potentially breaking sections of the castle.<br/>
You can counter this by using higher grade materials to build break-resistant castle parts.

### Castle Materials

The 5 categories of materials are "Soil", "Water", "Wood", "Rock", and "Iron Sand",<br/>
and the 3 grades of materials are "Normal", "Good", and "Perfect".<br/>
These materials can be used as regular items as well. (Materials page for details)

Perfect grade materials take up 2 inventory slots.<br/>
Materials can't be inserted into pots, but can be given to Mamo.<br/>
The location of each category and grade of material is shown in the following table:

As you can see, Perfect grade castle materials can be found in Shuten Trail Hard,<br/>
while Shuten Trail Easy only has Normal grade materials.<br/>
However, <span class="cautionText">Perfect Wood can only be found in the 2nd half of Shuten Trail Mid.</span><br/>Non-wood Perfect grade materials can only be found in the 2nd half of Shuten Trail Hard.<br/>It's easy to forget, so try to remember that when going on adventures.

Enemy monsters never drop castle materials when you trip or defeat them.

### Castle Parts

The 5 categories of castle materials are combined in various combinations to make castle parts.<br/>

As shown in the Castle Diagram:

<div class="dungeonImage">
  <img src="../images/other/castle_diagram.png" alt="Castle Diagram Image"/>
</div>

The combinations for each type of castle part are:

|Part|Materials|
|-|-|
|Honmaru|Soil, Water, Wood, Rock, Iron Sand|
|Ninomaru|Soil, Wood, Iron Sand|
|Inner Wall|Soil, Wood|
|Outer Wall|Soil, Water|
|Moat|Water, Rock|

Completing a castle section requires 4 of the same castle part.<br/>
So at minimum, you need 16 Soil, 12 Water, 12 Wood, 8 Rock, and 8 Iron Sand.<br/>
Prioritize Soil, Water, and Wood if you have to choose what to carry due to a full inventory.

The grade of materials determines the grade of castle parts.<br/>
The 4 castle part grades are "Frail", "Resistant", "Sturdy", and "Unbreakable".<br/>
Using all Perfect grade materials leads to an Unbreakable grade castle part,<br/>
which just as the name implies, will never break as a result of Oni attacks.

If the entire castle is built using Perfect grade parts, the castle turns into a Golden Castle.<br/>
It's possible to upgrade parts even after the castle is completed, so you don't need to build it<br/>using Perfect materials from the beginning, but it's a fun challenge to go for at some point.

### Oni Attacks

As you build the castle and progress the story, Oni will begin to launch attacks on the castle.<br/>
The attack event itself is automatic, so there's no gameplay or fighting involved.<br/>
As a result of the attack, a castle section built using lower grade parts might be destroyed.<br/>
It's best to use higher grade castle parts so that you don't end up having to rebuild sections.

One Perfect grade castle material can be found at the castle site after an Oni attack<br/>resulted in a castle part breaking.

## Post-Completion

Completing the castle grants access to Onigashima, and the ending plays after clearing it.<br/>Once you enter post-game, new ways to interact with your castle become available.

### Castle Decorations

<div class="dungeonImage">
  <img src="../images/other/castle_decoration.png" alt="Castle Decoration Image"/>
</div>

A variety of castle decorations can be obtained from post-game story events and dungeons.<br/>
Collecting castle decorations and displaying them is part of the fun of post-game in Shiren 2.<br/>
See the Castle Decorations page for details on where to obtain each decoration.

### Changing Parts / Golden Castle

You can upgrade sections of your castle using higher grade castle parts.<br/>
Try creating a Golden Castle by using Perfect grade castle parts for all sections.

### Fast Golden Castle

It's possible to return to 11F in Shuten Trail Mid by falling into a Pitfall on 12F,<br/>so one way to quickly collect Perfect Wood would be to bring a Trapper Bracelet<br/>and numerous Pitfalls to repeat 11\~12F.

Preparations:

* Strong weapon
* Strong shield
* Scout Bracelet
* Phantasm Bracelet
* Revival Grass
* Balance Staff
* Warp Grass, Slumber Scroll, etc. for emergencies.
* 10,000+ Gitan in case a Trader grabs castle materials.

Steps:

1. Level up at the Training Hall.
    * Equip a sword with many 幸 seals (Happy Grass) to boost experience gain.
2. Ride the cart to Shuten Halfway.
    * Give all of your items to Mamo, and don't forget to bring Mamo along.
3. Proceed to Shuten Mid or Hard for perfect materials.
    * Use Scout Bracelet to locate items, and take shortcuts using Phantasm Bracelet.
    * Kengo is the only monster you need to worry about.
    * Each run takes 7 minutes or so if you have optimal movement.
