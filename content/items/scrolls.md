If synthesized onto equipment with the 呪 seal, the 呪 seal is erased but it doesn't gain the 祓 seal.

### Slumber Scroll

Puts all monsters in the room to sleep for 10 turns, excluding monsters inside walls.<br/>
Monsters will act twice as fast when they wake up.<br/>
The 眠 seal grants a chance to put a monster to sleep for 5 turns when you attack it (weapon),<br/>or receive damage from a monster's direct attack (shield).<br/>
Sleep induced by the seal won't grant a speed increase after the monster wakes up.

### Explosion Scroll

Deals damage in a similar fashion to Landmines.<br/>
Place it on the ground and perform a direct attack to make it explode.<br/>
This is considered as an attack by Shiren, so if you blow up shop items or NPCs such as Traders,<br/>you'll be chased by Guard Dogs and Sherrifs.

Transforms the current floor into one giant room when read.<br/>
Water, ice, and unbreakable walls all vanish.<br/>
Best way to search for Golden Intervals, and also makes it easier to steal from shops.<br/>
Some care must be taken when reading it, or else you might find yourself waking up a monster house,<br/>or being under the effect of floor-wide statue effects.

Makes the selected pot unbreakable for the duration of the current adventure.<br/>
Good for storage, water, and monster pots, but can be bad if used on sticky or synthesis pots.<br/>

### Plating Scroll

Makes a weapon or shield rustproof with a red 金 seal. Cannot remove curses.<br/>
Can also repair bracelets, or transform iron arrows into silver arrows.<br/>
